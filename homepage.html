      <h2>General Information</h2>
        <h4>What it is</h4>
        <p>
          In the wake of Uber leaving Austin, and the shifting landscape of other, unstable ridesharing options there exists a smaller, local option.  Vincent's Car Service strives to provide the best possible service to a small number of clients using a limited number of elite drivers.  While by no means a direct competitor to anyone in the ridesharing market, the service provided is of a much higher quality, more akin to having a private chauffeur than a random (albiet immidiate) driver, but at a cost that won't break the bank.
