      <h2>Who am I</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a 22 year old, 5th year undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a degree in Computational Chemistry and a certification in Computer Science slated to graduate in May of 2017.  I'm an Austin native (which is quite uncommon these days), and plan to say in Austin after I graduate and will be looking for a job in software development, but that doesn't mean I'll stop being a driver!
      </p>
      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to starting my own business, I was an Uber driver working in the city of Austin.  However, leading up to Uber's departure from Austin, I anticipated those events and prepared myself for their leaving.  By getting my chauffeur's license, commercial insurance, and registering my own LLC, I could start my own service operating indpendently from any outside company, and began my customer base with the
        people who had me most frequently as an Uber driver and wanted to keep me as their permanant driver.  And it has spread through word of mouth ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been driving professionally in and around Austin for two and a half years, going as far as Dallas at times to get people where they need to go.  I drive an Infiniti Q50 (shown above) which is a full length luxury sedan that seats 4 + myself, with heated and cooled seats and many other ammenities.  Please allow me the chance to earn and keep your business for months and years to come.
